Variadic Functions have come to JavaScript thanks to ES2015. A **Variadic Function** is a function that can accept any number of arguments. For example: `funcName("one");` or `funcName("one", "two");` or `funcName("one", "two", "three");`.  

It can accept any number of argguments because the total number of parameters are unknown and can be adjusted at the time the method is called.

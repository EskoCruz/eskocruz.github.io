title: NPM Update
---

It is not something you may want to always keep updated.  

Check the latest version of NPM.  
https://www.npmjs.com/  

At the time of this post, the latest version is `3.5.0`  

To check your current npm version type:
`$ npm --version`

`3.3.12` is my npm version readout.

To upgrade my current version to the latest version, enter the following command:  
`npm install npm@latest -g`

I wanted to update "Kindle for Mac" app. I have it installed using bask cask.
Notice an application that's out-of-date in Homebrew-Cask? 

	$ brew cask info kindle
	kindle: 48016
	https://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/fiona/kcp-landing-page
	/usr/local/Caskroom/kindle/44182 (64B)
	/usr/local/Caskroom/kindle/48016 (64B)
	From: https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/kindle.rb
	==> **Name**
	Kindle for Mac
	==> **Artifacts**
	Kindle.app (App)

I looked to see what version of kindle is available and it shows brew cask has version "48016" availible. I went online and saw that the latest version is actually "50131".
In most cases, it's very simple to update it. We have a script that will ask for the new version number, and take care of updating the Cask file and submitting a pull request to us:

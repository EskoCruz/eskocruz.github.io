title: Installing Homebrew on Mac
---

First thing out is going to the Apple App Store and downloading then installing XCode. Appleâ€™s development software is used to build Mac and iOS apps. 

Next is to open up the terminal and install the Command Line Tools for Xcode.

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

You will be prompted to get the Command Line Tools for Xcode. Click Install.

Then the install of Homebrew itself. Paste this into the terminal:

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Next, will be asked to enter your password that will give homebrew sudo (admin) access.  
You will be prompted:
```bash
==> Installation successful?
==> Next steps
Run 'brew help' to get started
```

type `brew doctor` and if everything is good it will reply:  
```bash
your system is ready to brew
```

Congrats, Homebrew Installed

Before becoming a Javascript developer, I was an Actionscript developer creating flash sites and banners. I've created banner ads for a range of clients from Yahoo Fatasy Sports and NBC Sports US Open to Toshiba SSD and Verizon Wireless. I've decided to two of the best techneces creating html5 Banner Ads. Adobe Animation CC and GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP).

## Adobe Animation CC

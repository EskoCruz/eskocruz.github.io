title: What does (!) next to a cask mean

![Exclamation mark next to cask name]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/exclamation-mark-cask-name.png "Brew cask name with exclamation mark")  

When I used last used `brew cask list`, I noticed that one cask names had an exclamation mark next to it: `(!)`

It means the cask no longer exists. You installed it when it did. Search for it now, and it wonâ€™t find it.

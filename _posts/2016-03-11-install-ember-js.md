Make sure you have **Node** and **NPM** installed.  
Test to see if you have both installed and working correctly by typing the below commands on the command line.  
Both should output a version number:

    $ node -v
    $ npm -v

After verifying Node is installed correctly, you will globally install Ember CLI:

    $ npm install -g ember-cli

After installing Ember CLI, run `ember version` to show the running Ember CLI version.

    $ ember version

Printout will show similar to the following:

    ember-cli: 2.x.x
    node: 5.x.x
    os: XXXXX x64

Now you will have you access to the **ember command-line** runner.

title: Up and running with Jekyll!
---

I decided to migrate my blog from [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a website generator that's designed for building minimal, static blogs to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

I heard of and wanted to try out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I recently worked on a contract for a company that utilized [Atlassian's Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence). Confluence provites quick organize work, create documents, and discuss everything in one place. What I found extreamly useful was quick ability to create, share, and discuss your team's files and documents with comments, @mentions and likes.  
Most usefull was quickly creating documenting solutions to known issues, how-tos, and troubleshooting articles in a few clicks and share across your company, plus have active discussions with comments, @mentions and likes.
Now,  As a GitHub user, I'm entitled to one free "user" website, which will live at http://[git-username].github.io. This space is ideal for hosting a Jekyll blog!

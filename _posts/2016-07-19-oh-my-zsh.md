Install `zsh` for all the features offered by `oh-my-zsh`

Two ways to install oh-my-zsh now.  
Via curl  
	`$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`  
or via wget  
	`$ sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"`
NOTE: Do not copy and paste the `$` at the begining of the string. the `$` before the `sh` is reprecenting the prompt.

In order for Oh-My-Zsh to work, Zsh must be installed.  
- Please run `zsh --version` to confirm.  
- Expected result: `zsh 5.2` or more recent  

Additionally, Zsh should be set as your default shell.  
- Please run `echo $SHELL` from a new terminal to confirm.  
- Expected result: `/bin/zsh`  

## ZSH Settings

Before jumping into the next few sections, we need to know about ZSH settings. These are stored in a `.zshrc` file located in your home directory. It’s a hidden file, so you might not see it in your home directory, but you can view it by running `open ~/.zshrc` from the terminal. Swap out open with your favorite editor command, such as `nano`, `subl` or `vim`.

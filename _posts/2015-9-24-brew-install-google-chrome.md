title: Install brew Google Chrome

```bash
$ brew cask install google-chrome
==> Caveats
The Mac App Store version of 1Password won't work with a Homebrew-Cask-linked Google Chrome. To bypass this limitation, you need to either:

  + Move Google Chrome to your /Applications directory (the app itself, not a symlink).
  + Install 1Password from outside the Mac App Store (licenses should transfer automatically, but you should contact AgileBits about it).

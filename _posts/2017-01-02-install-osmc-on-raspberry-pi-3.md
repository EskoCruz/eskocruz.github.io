title: Install OSMC on Raspberry Pi 3
layout: post
---
Got someone special a Raspberry Pi 3 for Christmas. Raspberry Pi created this cute post about receiving this Pi for Christmas that I would like to share. [SO YOU GOT A RASPBERRY PI FOR CHRISTMAS! NOW WHAT?](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/so-you-got-a-raspberry-pi-for-christmas-now-what/)  

The reason for this gift was for them to upgrade their OSMC on Raspberry Pi 2 to more powerful Raspberry Pi 3 and knowing they would enjoy the journey.

## Setup

You should not just plan on installing this on your current Raspberry Pi you enjoy doing all the fun things you use it for.
This is not something you should share the process of your Pi. You would dedicate your Pi just for the purpose of being your Media Center.
This should take some preplanning and peripheral to utilize OSMC the best.

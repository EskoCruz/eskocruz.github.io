Install `zsh` for all the features offered by `oh-my-zsh`

Two ways to install oh-my-zsh now.  
Via curl  
	`$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`  
or via wget  
	`$ sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"`
NOTE: Do not copy and paste the `$` at the begining of the string. the `$` before the `sh` is reprecenting the prompt.
